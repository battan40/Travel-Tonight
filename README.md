# Travel Tonight

*Work on this project has slowed or stopped completely. Deadline 4/27/2021, 9pm MST.*

## Technologies Used

* `JavaScript`
* `HTML`
* `SCSS`
* `TDD with Mocha and Chai`
* `ARIA`
* `Webpack`
* `ES6 Fetch()`
* `ES6 POST`

## OverView

This project builds a travel booking app from scratch using new technologies gained this module. The intention behind the build was to gain experience with `ES6` `fetch()` and `POST` with error handling, and considerations for responsive accessibility.  Otherwise it was a chance to display my use of `OPP`, `TDD` and organization of data pulled in through `API`'s.

## Goals and Objectives

* Build app from the ground up
* Work with `API` to send and receive data
* Solidify code review process
* Create a robust test suite that tests all functionality of the app's client-side

## Setup

1. Clone down this repository
2. Using your command line, install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Get your local server going by running `npm start`
4. In a separate directory and terminal tab clone down [https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api]
5. Follow the instructions from the travel-tracker-api to get the server active
6. To view the page enter `http://localhost:8080/`

* To run tests enter `npm test` from the command line
* To run lint enter `npm run lint` from the command line

## Projects and Goals

* Use `OPP` to drive the design of the app and the code modularity
* `Fetch()`, `POST` and manipulate `API` data from the server consider
* Utilize `SCSS` as a default to streamline `CSS` styling
* App should be fully responsive
* Optimize accessibility to 100%
* Unit test sad/happy path for app functionality check and balance system
* Lighthouse score of 100% with accessibility considerations for UX/UI
* Semantic `HTML` for optimal accessibility
* Fetch request error handling for UX empathy
