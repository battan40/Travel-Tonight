## OverView

This project builds a travel booking app from scratch using new technologies gained this module. The intention behind the build was to gain experience with `ES6` `fetch()` and `POST` with error handling, and considerations for responsive accessibility.  Otherwise it was a chance to display my use of `OPP`, `TDD` and organization of data pulled in through `API`'s.

## Goals and Objectives

* Build app from the ground up
* Work with `API` to send and receive data
* Solidify code review process
* Create a robust test suite that tests all functionality of the app's client-side
